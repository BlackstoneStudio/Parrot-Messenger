# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2025-06-25

### Breaking Changes

- **AWS SES Configuration**: The AWS SES transport configuration has been restricted for security reasons. The `auth` field now only accepts:
  - `region` (string)
  - `accessKeyId` (string)
  - `secretAccessKey` (string)
  
  Additional AWS SDK configuration options (like `endpoint`, `maxRetries`, `httpOptions`, etc.) are no longer supported. This change prevents potential security misconfigurations and standardizes the authentication approach across all transports.

  **Migration Guide:**
  ```typescript
  // Before (v1.x)
  {
    name: 'ses',
    settings: {
      auth: {
        region: 'us-east-1',
        credentials: { accessKeyId: '...', secretAccessKey: '...' },
        endpoint: 'https://custom-endpoint',
        maxRetries: 3
      }
    }
  }

  // After (v2.0.0)
  {
    name: 'ses',
    settings: {
      auth: {
        region: 'us-east-1',
        accessKeyId: '...',
        secretAccessKey: '...'
      }
    }
  }
  ```
